# js_projects
A collection of my small or incomplete javascript projects.

## catan
My largest project by code volume. This was an attempt to recreate the popular board game as an online multiplayer browser game. I worked on this full time for nine days before realizing that this already exists on the internet.

## fourier
The user can draw a path with their mouse, and this program will convert that to a nearly equivalent sum of phasors path. This is done by feeding the path as a complex parametric function through a fourier transform for a range of frequencies.

## maps+
Procedurally generates and shades a square of terrain using layered perlin noise.

## minesweeper
A really big (144 x 144) game of minesweeper.

## retro game 1
The start of an attempt of mine to make an exploration game using procedurally generated terrain. Many of the assets and concepts are taken from minicraft.

## ascii art
A very simple utility for painting with ascii characters.

## physics box
A defunct 2D physics engine. I tried to implement arbitrarily-shaped hard body mechanics but ran into mathematical complexities and couldn't resolve wrong behaviors in a meaningful way.

## hexic
A clone of the game hexic, made in order to ... I don't rememeber, this was a long time ago. This is the only program here that doesn't run and I don't have a good reason to fix it.

## plates
A vague attempt at generating a structure of tectonic plates for use in procedural worldgen to try and alleviate some of the issues with layered noise. It runs incredibly slowly.
